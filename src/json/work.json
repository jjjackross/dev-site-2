        "Overview": "I built this site as my first official ReactJS project because it does not require a backend and has a simple overall structure making it a solid first option. After hand-sketching a rendering of the site, I used Penpot to create a more realistic mockup. I wanted it to be natural and easy to use while still feeling unique. The site grabs content from JSON files making it extremely easy to add or remove projects. After building the site with Node and ReactJS I bought the domain name and hosted the site on Netlify. I chose to host my site with Netlify because it is free, provides a free SSL certificate, has built-in continuous integration via GitHub and even provides a backend for my form.",

        "Overview": "Digital Huddle is a tech publisher that prides themselves on providing traditional methods and best practices for all things digital marketing. Digital Huddle was built on a custom wordpress theme with Advanced Custom Fields, PHP, JavaScript, WP Engine and Cloudflare. Advanced Custom Fields made it easy to add custom content without some of the constraints of a typical page builder. WP Engine is a very popular WordPress host and they made it extremely easy to host and manage our site. Cloudflare helps deliver content thus improving site speed while also providing a base level of cyber security. JavaScript and PHP are essential building blocks to any WP site.",

        "Overview": "Superior Succulents is a Shopify store and theme that I built from scratch. I built it as practice creating Shopify themes, as a portfolio piece, and so I have a 'playground' to try out whatever may come to mind. I chose to use TailwindCSS for this project so that I could learn a new way to handle CSS. JavaScript is used for some smaller DOM interactions as well as for communicating with the Shopify API and on-page forms. Liquid is the required templating language that Shopify uses. Finally, Alpine JS was used for DOM interactions, namely the search bar and mobile navigation menu, because of its less than 7kb file size",
